# CSSE2310
Computer Systems Principles and Programming (essentially Operating Systems and C Programming II)

---

These are all the assignments I wrote for the CSSE2310 course at The University of Queensland in S1 2023.

## Assignment Topics

- **a1**: NYT Wordle type command line game
- **a2**: 'The Bomb' assignment - debugging compiled code with unseen C code to solve for a series of secret codes needed to defuse.
- **a3**: Replicating the faculty test program used to evaluate student submission of assignment a1 against the known-good exemplar implementation across a wide array of custom test cases.
- **a4**: A multi-threaded server and client program that provides clients the ability to encrypt or brute force crack passphrases using the (now security-outdated) libcrypt POSIX library.

## Course description
"Systems Programming in C. Operating Systems Principles: memory management, basics of machine organization, file systems, processes & threads, interprocess communication. Computer Networks Principles: topologies & models of computer networks, protocols, network programming, network applications."
